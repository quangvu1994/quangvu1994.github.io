        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi! I'm Quang Vu - a software engineer student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I am a member of the Society of Software Engineers (SSE) at RIT where I work on some open projects such as web design and Brain Computer Interface. I am also passionate in developing games and Apps in general on iOS devices.
	<p>In Summer 2015, I worked as an intern at Weeby.co, a gaming company located at Mountain View, CA. During that time, I have learned a substantial knowledge in JavaScript and built my first game on iPhone, TapHero.</p>
	<p>One of my goals in life is to learn as much as I can. But, I don't forget to have fun sometimes. When I am not programming, I love to play soccer, hiking, and other outdoor activities with my friends.
