          About
        </h3>
        <p>Hey, I am Quang Vu. I graduted from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2018 with a Sofware Engineer bachelor degree. Currently, I am working as a Software Test Engineer at <a href="experience.html"><em>Veson Nautical</em></a> where I test software features and develop Automation tests. I always feel enthusiastic toward developing web and mobile applications so that is what I will try to pursue in the near future.
