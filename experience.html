              I spent my summer in 2017 at Make School to learn and develop native iOS applications. After 3 months, I have gained a substaintial knowledge about Swift, Google Firebase, and Social Login API. I also learned a lot about iOS concepts such as Delegation, MVC pattern, CoreData, TableView, CollectionView, Pagination, and Swift JSON. The result was that I completed building an Instagram clone and launched my own shopping application called <em>Exchange</em> to the AppStore. Please feel free to checkout and download the App <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/exchange-trade-yours-for-theirs/id1268849789?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a>.

          <h4>Software Test Engineer Intern</h4>
          <h5>Boston, MA</h5>
          <p>
              Working at Veson Nautical as an intern in the Spring 2017 was a blast. I had learned so much about developing automation tests for web products after 4 months using Python and Selenium. Since the project was new, I was pretty much the only person working on it at that time under the guidance of my mentor. Even though it was challenging, I really enjoyed working on the project and managed to develop about 500 automation test cases which reduced hours of manual testing to under 30 minutes. I am also very happy to see that after the success of my project, a new automation team was formed by the QA department to continue expanding the Automation program after I left.

            At Rheonix, I was part of both QA and Dev team working on developing new features and testing bugs for the Rheonix CARD cartridge machine. It is positioned to penetrate key molecular testing markets, from diagnostics labs to applied markets testing for food and beverage applications and next-generation sequencing sample preparation. I wrote part of the code including Unit tests for the machine's robot arm to move sample from one location to another using Java. In addition, I conducted Ad-hoc testings to find and fix bugs within the software.

              My first internship at Weeby.co was amazing. It was truly an incredible opportunity for me to learn about the Startup culture and game development. The fast paced working environment taught me to be a proactive and creative worker which was super helpful for my future employments. I was part of the front-end dev team to build games on mobile and web using Javascript, Weeby IDE (js.io), and DevKit game engine. During my time there, I was also able to build my little own game, <em>Tap Titan</em>, that you can check it out at my <a href="portfolio.html"><em>Portfolio</em></a> page using the technologies and resources available at the company.
